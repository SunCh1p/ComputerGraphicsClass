Modelings -> Transformation -> Rasterization

Transformation : modeling transformation, view transformation 

modeling transformation : moving vertices around 
view transformation: orthographics and perspective

Rasterization: finalize pixel values. After rasterization, everything is in  a frame buffer. 
                                        frame buffer is transferred to computer graphic device driver:


Components of computer system:
    primary layer: hardware layer(memory, peripherals, display drivers)
    secondary layer: Operating system(platform: linux, windows, embedded system) layer to communicate with hardware
    tertiary layer: application layer(software for platform)

    between secondary and tertiary, there is the libary layer. Libraries provide api for users to develop something on platform/

    layer between os and hardware layer is called the firmware layer(device drivers)

For this class, the api we use is called opengl, means application programming interface for user to access libary


api provided for api for viewing windows
glViewPort(x,y,z) <- device a viewing window for final step rasterization
